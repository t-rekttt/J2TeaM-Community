# J2TEAM COMMUNITY MEMBER RANKING SYSTEM

Our [J2TeaM Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/j2team.community/) group is maintained and developed with a ranking system called **J2TeaM Community Ranking**.

Here you can find all you need to know about this system.

## The reason we created J2TeaM Community Ranking

The J2TeaM Community group is created on October 6th, 2016 by Juno_okyo. **1000** members joined the first day. Till the last of December, after 2 months of operating, we had more than **4000 members**. Also it's not a bad amount of at all, the group activities are quite low, only some few boring new articles each day.

It does not looks like a group with some "few thousands of members" at all, Juno [decided](https://www.facebook.com/groups/j2team.community/permalink/409501726048620/) to write a tool that statistic the activity of all members in the group. It helps admins to [kick away](https://www.facebook.com/groups/j2team.community/permalink/409514332714026/) every members who joins the group and do NOTHING with ease. 

## How does J2TeaM Community Ranking works?

By collecting data from the group for the nearest 30 days, Juno's tool will "grade" all your activities in our group.

Which is counted as interaction?

- You **post** (or **share**) an article to the group.
- You **comment** on a group's article.
- Bạn **reaction** (Like/Love/Haha/Wow/Sad/Angry) trên một bài viết trong nhóm.
- You leave a **reaction** (Like/Love/Haha/Wow/Sad/Angry) on a post in the group.
- You publicity **share** a post in the group to your own wall.

All the things above counted as **interaction**. Our system grade you based on those activities. These are all basic activities on Facebook, so if you don't have any sign of being in the group for 30 days, you're kicked automatically.

Attention: Kicking is different from Blocking, you have the right to apply for a rejoin. But if you repeat that 3 times, you get **Blocked forever**.

## WHERE COULD I LOOKUP MY RANK?

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION

### Will I lose my points if my post gets deleted?

**You do**. Because the system gather everything from the beginning each time it update so when your post gets deleted, you got nothing to be gather.

### If I have no activity for a day, will my points stay the same?

**Nope**. Your points would decrease as the system only gather the information of the nearest 30 days. So when you being inactive, you points decreases. After 30 days without any activity, it goes back to 0.

### Why is my points lower than the previous day?

With this ranking algorithm, there will be adjustment in points (increase, decrease) for every members, everyday indepent from your level of activity. Because the rank is calculated from the active level of the whole nearest 30 days when it update.

Assume that today is the `n`th day, then points is gathered from the `(n-30)`th to `n`th.

So if in the `(n-31)`th, you score 500 points, but in the day `n`, you score 100 only then surely your point will decrease as the rank is limited till the `(n-30)`th day.

Don't worry because this algorithm applies to every members so there will be no **UNEXPECTED**. The factor which decides your rank based on the points that you score everyday comparing to others, that's all.

So instead of questioning "why do my points subtracted?", ask "why do people get subtracted but their rank increase?". Because the algorithm applies to EVERY MEMBERS IN THE GROUP, not JUST YOU, so the factor that decides your rank here is that do you interact enough to get subtracted less than people **the next day** or not. Remember everyone's points get added/subtracted like any other so it's totally fair. No favor.
