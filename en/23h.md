# #23o'clock show - J2TeaM Community

After 23 o'clock [every Friday](https://www.facebook.com/groups/j2team.community/permalink/418837418448384/), our [J2TeaM Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/j2team.community/) group allow members to post adult contents

To be approved, please obey the rules below:

- Your adult content must have **[18+ warning]** or similiar warning/hashtash at the beginning of the article.
- Do not post links that leads directly to adult websites to avoid being reported. Instead share the code for people to find links themselves.
- Still want to share links rather than codes? Encode them, or your posts get deleted. Recommended encryption:
 + [QR Code](https://zxing.org/w/decode.jspx)
 + [Hex](http://www.convertstring.com/EncodeDecode/HexDecode)
 + [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/)
- We will disable commenting of adult posts at 3-4 o'clock the next day to avoid them to rebump to the News Feed.

Attention: J2TeaM chatbot also support encoding/decoding text and links. Here are the commands:
- **encode**: Trigger encoding
- **decode**: Trigger decoding
- **qrcode**: Trigger QR Code decoding. You could send an image directly or send an image url instead. [See the demo](https://www.facebook.com/groups/j2team.community/permalink/416378562027603/).

A "standard" template for you to "copy" :trollface:
